# Raft-Simulator

An implementation to allow simulations of Raft in Omnet++ following the original [Raft paper](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf).

## Authors 
- Leonardo Ruzza
- Edoardo Venir

## Design 
Take a look at our [Wiki page](https://github.com/EdoardoV97/Raft-Omnet/wiki)

## Setup
Go to the official [Omnet++ website](https://omnetpp.org/) and follow the instruction to setup your environment.

Our code was tested on Omnet++ 5.7 - Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Running instruction
- Have a look at the [config file](https://github.com/EdoardoV97/Raft-Omnet/blob/main/raft/omnetpp.ini) to eventually change some simulation parameters
- To run the simulation, launch the [build file](https://github.com/EdoardoV97/Raft-Omnet/blob/main/build_clean.sh). Otherwise please refer to the Omnet++ guide
